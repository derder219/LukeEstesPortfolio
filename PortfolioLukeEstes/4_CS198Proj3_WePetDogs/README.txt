Project 3 for my class CS198, worked in a group to make a game in two months. 
The spec for this project can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16JgC3fr4wXy0Vt9BYMwUY5mFdA06QtnE4Wi4hx7ufNQ/edit
This class was an introduction to game design, taught by previous students of the class and alumni, to students who are interested in the game industry. 
The class allows artists, programmers, and musicians to join, but it is dominantly programmers in the class. 
We learned Unity very well and made many games through labs and projects.

Creators: Luke Estes, Rafael Calleja, Lea Nakatsukasa, Wendi Zhang, and Tiffany Cappelari.

Directory structure: This was a project made in Unity. 
Our scripts, and art (by Tiffany), are all located in the Assets folder. The scripts, located in the Scripts folder, I wrote entirely by myself, or almost so, were: Dog.cs, GameManager.cs, DogAndItemSpawner.cs, and Loader.cs.
The other scripts I contributed to were: Player.cs, BigObjectsTransparent.cs, and Zoom.cs.

Explanation/description of each code sample: Dog.cs is the class script for the dogs in our game. GameManager.cs is the GameManager that makes sure everything transitions properly and features are active at the right times. 
DogAndItemSpawner.cs is a script for spawning all the dogs and items in the world, as they spawn at random locations and we wanted to have random spawning. Loader.cs is just a script for loading our singletons if not up.
Player.cs is the class script for the user's player in the world. BigObjectTransparent.cs is for making large objects that would otherwise block a players view, go transparent when the player enters a certain hitbox. 
Zoom.cs is a script for zooming in and out with the mouse wheel.

Date when written: October - November 2018 we wrote and edited these scripts as we progressed on our game.
