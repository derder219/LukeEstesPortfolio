Project 3 for my class CS61A, worked solo to implement functions and classes required to make an iteration of the game PlantsVsZombies (AntsVsSomeBees) This was our first time looking at classes in the CS courses at Berkeley. 
The spec for this project can be found here: http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa17/proj/ants/
This class was meant partly an introduction to programming, but with a heavy workload. We mastered the programming languages Python and Scheme, as well as experienced a bit of SQL.

Creator: Luke Estes (with most code and the game engine given to us, as the goal was to teach us about classes in a fun way).

Directory structure: This was a project made on SublimeText3.
The only script edited was AntsVsSomeBees>ants.py. 

Explanation/description of each code sample: The game logic for the code was all built in ants.py, the one we edited. Although it's explained in more detail on the spec, we just went through and implemented what we were told to do.
We added classes, edited functions, and got to see how classes interacted with one another.

Date when written: 10/02/17 - 10/12/17 I edited the ants.py script as I progressed on the project.
