Project 2B for my class CS160, we were required to individually create an app that could interact with a user's location and a congressional API.
This app's focus was to show one's representatives based off their phone's location, an input zip code, or a randomize button.

The spec for this project can be found in the text file labeled ProjectSpec.txt
This class was an introduction to UI/UX, taught by Eric Paulos. The class was to help programmers get familiar with UI/UX concepts through the creation of many apps.
We created apps through Android Studio, using Java for the programming and Figma for design. We taught ourselves Android Studio individually while being taugh UI/UX concepts.
These concepts were reinforced via grading rubrics that evaluated the projects we submitted.
