Final Project for my class CS160; we were required to, in groups, create an app that was based off of the theme disabilities and accessibility.
This project's focus was for us to work in groups to actually create something we might present before companies as an idea for a new app.
The project was long but we spent many weeks meeting in our groups and working on our individual goals, meanwhile being evaluated by the staff each step of the way.

The details for how we made our project, are presented in the design document we had to submit for this project.
This class was an introduction to UI/UX, taught by Eric Paulos. The class was to help programmers get familiar with UI/UX concepts through the creation of apps and practicing the design cycle.
We created apps through Android Studio, using Java for the programming and Figma for design. We taught ourselves Android Studio individually while being taught UI/UX concepts.
These concepts were reinforced via grading rubrics that evaluated the projects we submitted.

Creators: Luke Estes, Vicky Tu, Jacob Chen, Alex Lazich, Duo Xu

Date when written: October - December 2018 my group was assigned this project, completed it, and presented it in front of our class.
