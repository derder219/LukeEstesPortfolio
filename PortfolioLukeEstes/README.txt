Hello! My name is Luke Estes and I have presented my portfolio in a numbered manner deliberately.
The first project was my first time ever seeing classes and the last project was making an app with many incredible features, quite the jump in a year.
I have only been coding since Fall 2017 and I feel I've made a great deal of progress since starting and wanted to showcase it via these projects of mine.
These times, though stressful they may be, have taught me almost everything I know about programming and game design/development.
I'd say about 90% of my learning happened outside the classroom and I'm really grateful to the UC Berekely CS program for its approach.
I was inspired to do things on my own, I was never shut down when asking a question, and I was pushed to my limits often.
I hope you enjoy!
