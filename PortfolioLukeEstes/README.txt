Hello! My name is Luke Estes and I have presented my portfolio in a numbered manner deliberately.
The first project was my first time ever seeing classes and the last project was making an alpha-version video game, quite the jump in a year I'd say. 
I have only been coding since Fall 2017 and I feel I've made a great deal of progress since starting and wanted to showcase it via these projects of mine.
I've spent many grueling hours getting necessities to work on my windows computer before I can even start assignments, 
all just to spend an even longer amount of time doing my assignments. 
These times, though stressful they may be, have taught me almost everything I know about programming and game design/development (Unity).
I'd say about 90% of my learning happened outside the classroom and I'm really grateful to the UC Berekely CS program for its approach.
I was inspired to do things alone, I was never shut down when asking a question, and I was pushed to my limits often.
I hope you enjoy!
